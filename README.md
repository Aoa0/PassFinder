# PassFinder
PassFinder is an automated approach to detecting passwords in code files written in different programming languages. 

`context.csv` contains the raw dataset for the Context Model. For more details you can read our [paper](https://aoa0.github.io/pubs/icse22.pdf). For desensitization, we have removed the passwords in the code snippets. If you find any unexpected sensitive information in the dataset, please let us know.
